# 🛡️ Audit Logger (C++)

A beginner-friendly C++ program that simulates an audit log entry — useful for understanding how input/output works in C++ and how basic cybersecurity tools start from simple concepts.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Prompts the user for their **full name**
- Prompts for an **action performed** (e.g., login, logout, delete file)
- Outputs a **formatted audit log entry**

Example:
Enter your full name: Francis Ofosu
Enter action performed: login
[AUDIT] Francis Ofosu performed 'login'

## 🧠 What I Learned

- C++ program structure
- Using `std::string` and `std::getline()` for full text input
- Combining multiple input and output statements
- Organizing clean, readable output
- Why `.gitignore` matters in software projects

## 🧰 Technologies

- Language: `C++`
- IDE: `Visual Studio`
- Version Control: `Git`, `GitHub Desktop`
